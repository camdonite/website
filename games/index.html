					Remember that silly game that you would play in English class, where you take turns drawing segments in a grid of dots? 
					Being a 3 Dimensional version of the same game, the moves that are available are suddenly much more complex. 
					The "Segments for Cubes" game mode explores the mechanic of winning cubes instead of squares, and the "Planes for Cubes" game mode takes this a step further, where each move is a plane.
